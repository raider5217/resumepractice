      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr />
      <p style="font-size: 25px">
        My name is Jason. I'm on my way to <strong><em>50</em></strong> years
        old and I finally figured out what I'd like to do in life. I wish I'd
        have found out sooner, but better late than never. I have a beautiful
        Wife and three great kids. Pain in the rear sometimes, but who isn't,
        right? My job...my job is ok. I don't hate my job. But it's just
        that...a job. I don't really get any fulfillment from it. Pays the
        bills. I found HTML, CSS around 10 years ago (give or take). Didn't
        really do anything outside of messing around every now again. Didn't put
        ANY effort into it. Really only looked at it a few times over the ten
        years. Job came first, "concentrate on the job. Make the money. work,
        home, sleep. repeat". Then about a year ago I felt the pull again. But,
        this time I didn't push it down. Still busy with work and learning stuff
        there, but I'm playing around a lot more. Building little things here
        and there. Not the greatest but fun for me. I figure if I spend hours
        upon hours trying to find mistakes I've made in my code and am not
        getting angry, then I really like it. I have given myself a goal of
        about two years to mostly understand HTML, CSS & JS. (I know others are
        laughing at the prospect of it taking me a couple of years but, so what.
        The more we work on something the better it becomes.). I hope that
        anyone who reads this will leave a constructive commet. Thank for your
        time.
